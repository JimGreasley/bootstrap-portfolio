# bootstrap-portfolio

  This project is comprised of three pages: an index (About Me), a contact and a portfolio.
  Each page is built utilizing the Bootstrap Grid - containers, rows and columns.
  Each page contains a NavBar at top and a sticky footer (still working on this).

  The index.html page will eventually display a picture of me and a "About Me" description.
  The portfolio page will eventually show the various projects I have created/worked on
  during this course.
  The contact page will eventually allow someone to contact me via an email.
