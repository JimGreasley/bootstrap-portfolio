# bootstrap-portfolio

  My professional portfolio is comprised of a single page built utilizing the Bootstrap Grid - containers, rows and columns.  The NavBar at top contains links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, as well as, a dropdown for my phone number and email.

  Below the "About Me" section, are cards outlining the various projects I've worked on and homework assignments that I've completed. They illustrate the various technologies introduced throughout the coding boot camp.
