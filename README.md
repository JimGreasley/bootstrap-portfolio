# bootstrap-portfolio

  My professional portfolio is comprised of a single page built utilizing the Bootstrap Grid - containers, rows and columns.  The NavBar at top contains links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, as well as, a dropdown for my cell phone number and email.

  Below the "About Me" section, are cards outlining the various group projects I've worked on and a few of my homework assignments. Collectively, they illustrate the various technologies introduced throughout the coding boot camp.
